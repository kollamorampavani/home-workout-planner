# 🏋️ FitVibe: Home Workout Planner
A premium, fully responsive fitness management dashboard built using React.js, TypeScript, and Node.js with a Supabase PostgreSQL backend.

This project demonstrates frontend–backend integration, complex state management, data visualization with charts, and a high-end glassmorphism design system.

🚀 **Live Demo**
- **Frontend (Vercel):** [https://home-workout-planner-navy.vercel.app](https://home-workout-planner-navy.vercel.app)

✨ **Features**
- **Personalized Onboarding:** Users set their name, fitness goals (Strength, Fat Loss, Flexibility), and available workout time.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Greeting changes based on time of day, showcasing user stats like Community Points, Global Rank, and Mission of the Day.
- **Workout Management:** Browse and enroll in curated workout routines. Track exercises, duration, and calories burned.
- **Progress Tracking:** Interactive charts (using Recharts) visualize weekly calorie burn and muscle group focus distribution.
- **Community & Gamification:** Join community challenges, earn points, and climb the leaderboard with other athletes.
- **Activity Feed:** Real-time feedback for community activities like challenge completions and new personal records.
- **Premium UI/UX:** Stunning Dark Mode interface with Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations (Framer Motion), and responsive layout for all devices.

🧩 **Component Overview**
- **MainLayout.tsx:** Handles the persistent sidebar navigation and mobile-responsive header.
- **Dashboard.tsx:** The primary user hub displaying progress stats and the daily mission.
- **Workouts.tsx:** Searchable library of routines with enrollment functionality.
- **Tracker.tsx:** Visual representation of user data using Area and Bar charts.
- **Community.tsx:** Manages challenges, leaderboards, and the social activity feed.
- **Onboarding.tsx:** Initial user setup flow for personalizing the workout experience.

💾 **Data Handling**
- **Database:** Powered by **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**, ensuring persistent storage for user profiles, workout history, and enrolled routines.
- **State Management:** Uses **Zustand** with persistence to manage authentication tokens and user session data across browser reloads.
- **Hybrid Support:** The project is backend-ready; it communicates with a live Node.js server but is designed to handle local state gracefully during initial loads.

🧠 **Key Concepts Explored**
- Component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety.
- Advanced CSS techniques: Glassmorphism, CSS Variables, and Flex/Grid layouts.
- RESTful API integration with Express and Axios.
- Relational database schema design for complex user-workout relationships.
- Client-side data visualization and responsive design.
